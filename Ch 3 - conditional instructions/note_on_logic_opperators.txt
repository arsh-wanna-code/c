note : 
'if (0)' does not work...
hence logic operators are used to shorten the code and increase the readability
eg.,


if (a == 1)
{
    if (b == 1)
    {
        printf("true");
    }
}


can be written as,


if (a&&b)
{
    printf("true");
}


this works, as in the first code, printf works only when both a and b are true(1)
the same works with the second code as && is the AND opperator,
so if any of the a or b are false(0) the code doesn't execute.
other logical opperators are || and ! which are OR and NOT opperators respectively.
