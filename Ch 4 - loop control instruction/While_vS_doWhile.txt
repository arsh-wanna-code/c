while Loop: The condition is checked before the execution of the loop body. 
            If the condition is false at the start, the loop body will not execute even once.
            There is no guarantee that the loop body will execute even once if the condition is false initially.


do-while Loop: The condition is checked after the execution of the loop body. 
               Meaning the loop body will execute at least once, whether the condition is true or false initially.
               The loop body is guaranteed to execute at least once as the condition is evaluated after the execution.
